# Rock-Paper-Scissors AI

This project is a simple implementation of the classic game **Rock, Paper, Scissors**, but with an AI component. The AI learns and adapts based on the opponent's moves, making it a challenging opponent to play against.

## Project Overview

This project uses Python and basic AI techniques to create an intelligent Rock-Paper-Scissors player. The AI plays against different bots and aims to win at least 60% of the matches.

## Features

- AI plays Rock-Paper-Scissors against different bots.
- The AI adapts based on the previous moves of the opponent.
- Tracks statistics of wins, losses, and draws.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository to your local machine or Gitpod workspace:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/srepasup/Rock-Paper-Scissors-AI.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   cd Rock-Paper-Scissors-AI

3. Install the required dependencies (if any):
   pip install -r requirements.txt

4. Run the game script:
   python RPS.py

How It Works
The player function takes in the last move of the opponent and returns the next move based on some AI logic.

The game tracks the results of each match and adapts based on the opponent's history.

The goal is to win at least 60% of the matches against different bots.
